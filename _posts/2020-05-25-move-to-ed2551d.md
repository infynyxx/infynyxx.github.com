I finally migrated all my SSH keys from using RSA to [Ed25519](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliptic_Curve_Digital_Signature_Algorithm). Just make sure, you have `OpenSSH 6.5` or greater installed.

* Generate Ed25519 Key: `ssh-keygen -o -a 100 -t ed25519 -f ~/.ssh/id_ed25519 -C "praj@infynyxx.com"`
* Make sure SSH Agent is running: `eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"`
* Add generated Ed25519 key to SSH Agent: `ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_ed25519`
* Update `~/.ssh/config` file:
    ``` bash
    Host *
    AddKeysToAgent yes
    UseKeychain yes
    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
    ```
* Add the private-key to the SSH Agent: `ssh-add -K ~/.ssh/id_ed25519`
